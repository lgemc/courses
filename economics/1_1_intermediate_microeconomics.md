# ECON 1010A - Intermediate Microeconomics

## Overview
This course introduces core microeconomic models of consumers, firms, and markets, with extensive applications to real-world issues. It builds on principles learned in introductory microeconomics with more rigorous analytical tools.

## Core Topics

### Consumer Theory
- Utility functions and preferences
- Indifference curves and budget constraints
- Utility maximization and demand derivation
- Income and substitution effects
- Consumer surplus and welfare analysis

### Producer Theory
- Production functions and isoquants
- Cost minimization
- Short-run and long-run costs
- Profit maximization
- Supply curves derivation

### Market Structures
- Perfect competition equilibrium
- Monopoly pricing and welfare losses
- Monopolistic competition
- Oligopoly and strategic behavior
- Price discrimination strategies

### General Equilibrium
- Partial vs. general equilibrium
- Efficiency and the welfare theorems
- Exchange economies
- Production economies

### Market Failures
- Externalities (positive and negative)
- Public goods
- Asymmetric information
- Moral hazard and adverse selection

### Game Theory Basics
- Strategic form games
- Nash equilibrium
- Dominant strategies
- Applications to firm behavior

## Mathematical Tools
- Calculus-based optimization
- Lagrangian methods
- Comparative statics
- Mathematical modeling

## Learning Objectives
- Master core microeconomic models
- Apply calculus to economic analysis
- Analyze market outcomes and efficiency
- Evaluate policy interventions using microeconomic theory
- Develop rigorous analytical reasoning

## Applications
Real-world applications include:
- Antitrust policy and market power
- Environmental regulation
- Labor market policies
- Healthcare markets
- Technology and innovation

## Prerequisites
ECON 10A; calculus recommended (Mathematics 1A or equivalent)
