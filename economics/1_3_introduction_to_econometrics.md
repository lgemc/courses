# ECON 1123 - Introduction to Econometrics

## Overview
This course introduces multiple regression techniques with a focus on economic applications. Students learn to analyze data using statistical methods, including panel data and time series models, to test economic theories and inform policy decisions.

## Core Topics

### Regression Basics
- Simple linear regression
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Interpretation of coefficients
- Goodness of fit (R-squared)
- Statistical inference

### Multiple Regression
- Multiple regression model
- Omitted variable bias
- Multicollinearity
- Specification tests
- Functional forms

### Statistical Inference
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- t-tests and F-tests
- p-values and significance levels
- Type I and Type II errors

### Model Specification
- Choosing explanatory variables
- Linear vs. nonlinear models
- Dummy variables
- Interaction terms
- Model selection criteria

### Regression Assumptions
- Linearity
- Exogeneity and endogeneity
- Homoskedasticity
- No autocorrelation
- Normality of errors

### Violations and Solutions
- Heteroskedasticity detection and correction
- Serial correlation in time series
- Multicollinearity diagnosis
- Robust standard errors

### Panel Data Methods
- Fixed effects models
- Random effects models
- Difference-in-differences
- Panel data advantages

### Time Series Analysis
- Stationarity and unit roots
- Autoregressive models
- Moving averages
- ARIMA models
- Forecasting

### Causality and Identification
- Correlation vs. causation
- Instrumental variables
- Natural experiments
- Regression discontinuity design
- Randomized controlled trials

### Practical Applications
- Labor economics (wage equations)
- Financial economics (asset pricing)
- Development economics
- Health economics
- Environmental economics

## Software and Tools
- Statistical software (Stata, R, or Python)
- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Visualization of results
- Interpreting software output

## Learning Objectives
- Understand regression analysis fundamentals
- Estimate and interpret econometric models
- Identify and address statistical issues
- Apply econometric methods to economic questions
- Critically evaluate empirical research

## Applications
This course prepares students to:
- Conduct empirical economic research
- Analyze real-world data
- Test economic hypotheses
- Inform policy with data analysis
- Read and evaluate academic papers

## Prerequisites
ECON 10A, ECON 10B; statistics and calculus recommended
